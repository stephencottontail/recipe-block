# Recipe Block #

Don't you just hate it when you're looking for a nice new recipe and some pretentious food blogger thinks it's necessary to write 1000+ words about the recipe before they get around to the good part? Based on the majority of food blogs out there, no, you don't. But if you do, here's a way to get the best of both worlds: you can write your 1000-word essay while your readers can easily hide it so they can get to the good part.

## TODOs ##

This isn't an entirely serious project, but there are actually a few things that might be nice to do:

* Allow images
* Allow metadata like cooking time, vegetarian/vegan/dairy-free/gluten-free/etc.
